# Ant Design Starter App
A simple movie listing app created with react.js using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) components backed by API provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

The demo of this project is hosted on Github Page, [checkout preview](https://infantajayvenus.github.io/ant.design-starter-app).

## Using the Repo
The template project for [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app).

### Requirements
-   Node.JS
-   Registered [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) account to get API key.

### Steps
1. Clone or download the repo and navigate to this project directory.
2. Create a file named `.env` and add the following line,
```
MDB_KEY=<The API key you got from The Movie Database>
```
3. Run the command `npm install`.

4. `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.
5. `npm run build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.
